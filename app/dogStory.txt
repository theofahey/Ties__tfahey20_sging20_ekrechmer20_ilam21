Stupid dog! Your # is dragging you down the road, your heels scraping the concrete, trying not to fall. Moments later, you fall anyway, into an # puddle, getting # all over you. Just then, seeing your dog, a bunch of other dogs decide they want a new best friend, so a #, #, and # trample over you, leaving you to # on the ground, covered in # dog prints and puddle stuff. You # stand up, # towards your dog, but then you forget which one is yours, so you grab the first one you see. Your neighbor comes up to you and asks, “Why are you holding that # #?” You reply, “I don’t know, I think it’s cute,” and # away, not in any mood to take her judgy looks. Your neighbor stands there, looking like a(n) # and # #.
