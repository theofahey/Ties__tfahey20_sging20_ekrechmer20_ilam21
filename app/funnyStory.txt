“Can we get a round of applause for that last comedian?” No. You are not clapping. All he did was tell # jokes. He opened with, “#.” Please, that’s child’s play. Well, maybe if a child was # and #. Honestly, he looked like a complete # up there. The worst joke was “#”–How do you even # something that #? At least the food was #. You ate some #, and gulped down a #, stuffing yourself to distract from the comedian. As you’re #, your stomach begins to rumble. Great. Guess the food wasn’t #. You # to the bathroom and #, surprised that it took so long. Ugh, you just remembered the closing joke: #. Did you have fun? #. This is the most # comedy club ever, and every single comedian loves to #. You’re never coming back.
