  “Can we get a round of applause for that last comedian?” No. You are not clapping. All he did was tell adjective jokes. He opened with, “{{joke1}}.” Please, that’s child’s play. Well, maybe if a child was adjective and adjective. Honestly, he looked like a complete noun up there. The worst joke was “{{joke2}}”–How do you even verb something that adjective? At least the food was adjective. You ate some food and food, and gulped down a drink, stuffing yourself to distract from the comedian. As you’re verb ending in -ing, your stomach begins to rumble. Great. Guess the food wasn’t adjective. You verb to the bathroom and verb, surprised that it took so long. Ugh, you just remembered the closing joke: {{joke3}} Did you have fun? Yes or No.This is the most adjective comedy club ever, and every single comedian loves to verb adverb. You’re never coming back. <br>
